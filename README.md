Viz-Dashboaard is a live data solution for VizRT

What do I use this for?

- I use this during live- sports productions to easily trigger on screen graphic animations
  

How does it work?

1. Launches a web application
2. Web app has a config page where users can adjust inputs per their needs
3. After configuring, the main page will have the users preferred buttons (name, color, and what they want their XML element to be called)
4. These buttons can be toggled
5. They default as '0' in an inactive state
6. When toggled the change to the value '1' with an active state
7. The application sees these changes and updates the corresponding values in an XML file
8. XML file can then be used to trigger animations with the VizRT DataPool plugin
